[Write Code that is Easy to Delete, Not Easy to Extend.](https://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/write-code-that-is-easy-to-delete-not-easy-to?source=post_page-----56b0d9de2c43--------------------------------)

## Article Response: 
The article talks about how software engineers should write code that is **"easy to delete."** What the article means by this is that engineers should design their software in a way that allows outdated part to be removed without breaking the entire system. 

This idea slightly goes against the idea of making the software exstensible. This article suggest that coders should focus more on making code that can be easily replaced or removed in the future to avoid complex maintance and encourage simpler modifications in the future. 

## Comment from Ethan Arnold

It makes a lot of sense that we should write code that's easy to delete, since shooting for that quality incentivizes modularity and great coding conventions. Such a mindset also possesses an implicit growth-mindset, always keeping in mind that the code will be improved, overwritten, and changed in ways currently unknowable.
